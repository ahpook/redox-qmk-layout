# redox-qmk-layout

Repo to version-track my QMK layout for redox 

Handwired redox v1 pcb + 3d-printed case. Gazzew boba 'thocky' switches under
[DSA alchemy](https://spkeyboards.com/collections/alchemy-keycap-sets) caps.

QMK layout is modeled after my Kinesis Advantage but with some redox-specific mods.
